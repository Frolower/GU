As we can see on the graphs, insertion sort in all cases, except sorting descending sorted vector, show better time to finish. I think it happens because insertion sort just swaps the smallest value, located on the back of the vector with the biggest value at the front of the vector, so each time we store 2 values. Bubble sort is always the slowest one, which is obvious, even with the sorted vector, where selection sort shows ten times more operations. As for random vectors, it's strange to me that the selection sort shows the same performance as the insertion sort and I donâ€™t know how to explain it.
